# Track & Trace App

Mobile app that tracks all person-to-pertson encounters or visits of public places with secured codes that cant be used to pensonally identify any user.

## How it works :
All Public places to enforce policy to restrict entry to those who have a Tracking Code.
All visitors will setup Tracking Code once and use the same code (unique key)

When Anyone scans anyone's Tracking code, a virtual meeting is recorded in the Apps backend Database. The same record is also stored in the Users mobile device locally in encrypted format.

When anyone is detected as positive, we expect the person to voluntarily mark himself as infected, or the Authorities can overide citizen rights (under abnormal situations like COVID-19) and forcefully mark the individuals code as "infected".

When any infection is recoded, backend App send a broadcast message to all Users who potentially came in contact/vicinity of the infected person.

Strongly suggested for all Public Places like Banks, Shops, schools, Colleges, Offices, Factories, Hospitals, Police Stations, Bus Terminus, Train Stations to restrict entry only with Tracking Code.

The Data stored do not not have any personally identifiable information and is openly visible to all.
